            <strong>Name:</strong> Nucleic Acids<br>
            <strong>Composition:</strong> Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).<br>
            <strong>Monomer:</strong> DNA & RNA<br>
            <strong>Types:</strong><br>
            <strong>DNA:</strong> Nucleotides join to form nucleic acids. 
            Two nucleic acid strands join to form DNA. RNA is one nucleic acid strand.
            Each nucleotide is a complicated molecule with three parts: a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogen base. The sugar and phosphate are the same in all nucleotides. 
            In DNA, the four nitrogen bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). These four nitrogen bases can be sequenced in any order on a strand of DNA. 
            DNA is a ladder-like structure.  It is made up of two nucleic acid strands twisted together. This structure is called a double helix.
            Covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next nucleotide bond nucleotides together in a strand. This is called a sugar-phosphate backbone. 
            The backbone forms the sides of the DNA ladder.
            <br>
            This is how a DNA double helix is formed:
            <br>
            1.  Two nucleic acid strands line up next to each other. <br>
            2.  The sugar-phosphate backbone of the two strands form the sides of the ladder. <br>
            3.  The bases of the two strands bond to one another with hydrogen bonds and form the rungs of the ladder.<br>
            4.  The ladder twists into a spiral to form a double helix.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>RNA:</strong> RNA must first translate this genetic code in DNA. RNA is essential for protein synthesis. RNA differs from DNA in four ways:
            RNA has an extra OH group, or hydroxyl group. 
            RNA uses a base called uracil (U) instead of the base thymine (T).
            RNA is a single-stranded molecule and takes various unique shapes. It can even form base pairs with itself so that it can fold into many shapes.
            RNA uses the sugar ribose. DNA uses the sugar deoxyribose.
            <br>
            <strong>Function:</strong> <br>
            Nucleic acids serve as information storage molecules. They provide the directions to make proteins.<br>
            Both DNA and RNA are polymers. They are both made up of thousands of linked monomers called nucleotides. Two important nucleic acids are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). DNA contains genes, the hereditary blueprints for all life.<br>
