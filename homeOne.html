            <strong>Definition:</strong> "The study of the development, structure, and functioning of human society."<br>
            <strong>My Definition:</strong>The way that we study how a society works and evolves over time.<br>
            <strong>Examples:</strong>From my research I concluded that the Social Structure and Functions <br>For a stable environment are education, family, economy, ritual, and faith.<br>
            <strong>Types:</strong><br>
            <strong>Education:</strong> Education is essentially developing men and women into making/doing new things never done before and not repeating history.<br>
            <strong>Family:</strong> Family is more than just the people related by blood. It's the true people in your life that you can go to for anything and can be there for you<br>
            <strong>Faith:</strong> To describe what faith is, it's something more powerful than anything really existing. It's a power that can get people through tough times and is a little spark in someones heart to keep trying to accomplish something. One example of
            faith that always stands out to me is in my favorite movie Rocky. In this movie, the protagonist Rocky, is faced with brutal challenges and seems to never give up till he wins by keeping faith in his mind.<br>
            <strong>Economy:</strong>Economy is what drives people to go out and want to work everyday. It's something extremely complicated with a complex flow. It gets society moving everyday to go out and make money, trade money, and spend money. Everyone knows you have to work hard to get money which is basically the economy.<br>
