            <strong>Name:</strong> Proteins<br>
            <strong>Composition:</strong> carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms<br>
            <strong>Monomer:</strong> amino acids. Each of the 20 amino acids has a central carbon atom with four covalent bonds. These bonds link the carbon atom to an amino group (—NH2), a carboxyl group (—COOH), a hydrogen atom (H), and an R group<br>
            <strong>Types:</strong><br>
            <strong>The R Group:</strong> The R group gives a particular amino acid its special chemical properties.            <br>
            <strong>Peptides:</strong> A peptide is a compound made up of two or more amino acids.
            When two amino acids bond, they form a dipeptide and a water molecule. 
            The water molecule is removed by dehydration synthesis to form the peptide bond.						
            When amino acids join together in a long chain, the compound is called a polypeptide.
            The peptide bonds in a protein can be broken by hydrolysis; that is, by adding water.<br>
            <strong>Function:</strong> <br>
            Proteins provide support to elements of the human body such as hair, skin, muscle tissue, bones, and teeth. Protein also supports the skin and internal organs.<br>
Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen.
Other proteins are enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that brings about a chemical reaction in an organism.
The human body cannot synthesize, or make nine amino acids.
The nine essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. 
A cell will stop making a protein even if one essential amino acid is missing. The result is a truncated, or shortened, polypeptide.
A diet that does not include complete proteins will negatively affect health.
If the temperature or the pH changes in a cell, proteins may come apart and lose their shape.
Contractile proteins are found in muscles to help them grow and expand.
The small intestine absorbs broken down proteins, or amino acids, into the blood, which are then carried to all parts of the body.
