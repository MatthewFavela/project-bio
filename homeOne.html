            <strong>Name:</strong> Carbohydrates<br>
            <strong>Composition:</strong> Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen<br>
            <strong>Monomer:</strong> Monosaccharides, Polysaccharides, and Disaccharides.<br>
            <strong>Types:</strong><br>
            <strong>Monosaccharides:</strong> Mono- means “one.” When monosaccharides are broken down in the cell, the reactions release energy and give off carbon dioxide
            The two most common monosaccharides are fructose and glucose. Fructose and glucose are isomers. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different structures and shapes.
            <br>
            <strong>Disaccharides:</strong> Disaccharides are two monosaccharides bonded together.
            Sucrose, or table sugar, is another disaccharide. It is made up of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose. It is obtained from sugarcane and sugar beet roots.  
            <br>
            <strong>Polysaccharides:</strong> Polysaccharides are one monosaccharides.
            The most common polysaccharides are starch, cellulose, and glycogen. Glycogen is the main storage form of glucose in animals and humans. It is stored in liver and muscle cells.
            Cellulose is a strong, rigid molecule that is used for plant structures such as stems, leaves, and wood.
            Starch is a carbohydrate made up of long chains of glucose molecules.
            Plants produce glucose to use as an energy source.
            If a plant makes more glucose than it needs, the extra molecules are stored in the form of starch. 
            <br>
            <strong>Function:</strong> <br>
            The body needs carbohydrates for energy.<br>
            Without carbohydrates, the body will break down certain tissues to use their proteins.
            Carbohydrates also make up a part of the membrane structure of cells. They help cells communicate and recognize one another.
